            IPv6 NAT - A NAT(network address translation) for IPv6

1. Instructions

    This is a simple NAT for IPv6. Make sure if you really need it before
    using it. (If you don't know what is a NAT, you don't need it.)

    Before running this, please:
    * Disable IPv6 kernel forwarding;
    * Block out-going IPv6 TCP reset packets on WAN interface;
    * Block out-going ICMPv6 neighbour-advertisement packets on LAN
      interface;
    * Block out-going ICMPv6 destination-unreachable packets.

    Usage:
	ipv6_nat LAN_interface [-w WAN_interface_number] WAN_interface0 [WAN0_router_MAC] [WAN_interface1 [WAN1_router_MAC]]...

    "ipv6_nat.sh" is an example to run this tool.

    Static port mapping is configured in /etc/ipv6nat_port_map.conf , each
    line of which contains a port mapping definition. For example:

      tcp  4422  00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE  2001:2:3:4:00af:cfaa:bbcc:ddee  22  0

    defined a TCP port mapping from [2001:2:3:4:00af:cfaa:bbcc:ddee]:22 to
    [WAN IP]:4422 via WAN interface 0, where 00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE is the MAC address of
    [2001:2:3:4:00af:cfaa:bbcc:ddee].
    NOTE: each line starts with '#' will be treated as comment and ignored!


2. System Requirements

    * OS is Linux;
    * IPv6 is compiled into the kernel;
    * ip6tables is installed.


3. Functions

    * IPv6 auto configuration (If you run it on the gateway, all the PCs
      in the LAN will get 'fake' IPv6 global addresses and IPv6 route);
    * Port forwarding for TCP, UDP and ICMP-Echo;
    * Static port mapping for TCP and UDP;
	* Multiple WAN interfaces are supported.
